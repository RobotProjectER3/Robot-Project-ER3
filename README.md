# Robot Project ER3

This project was made by 6 GEII students from the IUT of Annecy (France)

## Introduction

The idea was to develop an Android and Arduino code which could control a 4 wheeled robot distributed by the Chinese company, DFRobot founded in 2008. DFRobot is a world-leading robotics and open source hardware provider who creates and sells small Arduino and Raspberry Pi kits for beginners and amateurs from all around the world.
The purpose of the 3rd semester project of our 2nd year of “GEII”, is to control one of these robots with our smartphones via Bluetooth connectivity.


## Coding
To code this project we used 2 different programming codes:
### Android
We used "Android Studio" for 
```
Projet_ROBOT_android
```
which is the phone app

### Arduino
And "Visual Studio" (the Arduino software could have been used too) for
```
Projet_ROBOT_android
```
which is the robot part


## Hardware
We explained about what we hade for this project in our [drive](https://google.com)
